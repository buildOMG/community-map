# community-map

The following is a list of the known community assets and channels of omise go. 

## Github Repositories

The OMG Network Community codebase is broken up into two organizations: Build OMG and OMG Network. The OMG Network organization is intended to be a separate place to publically show basic information related to learning the ins and outs of the OMG Network. The build.OMG channel is intended to contain a knowledge base, and to host other community projects in the scope.
